# ðŸŸ¥ Task-5 Firewall & Network Protection

What is a firewall?

Per Microsoft, "Traffic flows into and out of devices via what we call ports. A firewall is what controls what is - and more importantly isn't - allowed to pass through those ports. You can think of it like a security guard standing at the door, checking the ID of everything that tries to enter or exit".

The below image will reflect what you will see when you navigate to Firewall & network protection.

Note: Each network may have different status icons for you.

What is the difference between the 3 (Domain, Private, and Public)?

Per Microsoft, "Windows Firewall offers three firewall profiles: domain, private and public".

- Domain - The domain profile applies to networks where the host system can authenticate to a domain controller. 
- Private - The private profile is a user-assigned profile and is used to designate private or home networks.
- Public - The default profile is the public profile, used to designate public networks such as Wi-Fi hotspots at coffee shops, airports, and other locations.

If you click on any firewall profile, another screen will appear with two options: turn the firewall on/off and block all incoming connections.

Warning: Unless you are 100% confident in what you are doing, it is recommended that you leave your Windows Defender Firewall enabled.
