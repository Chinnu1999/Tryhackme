What is BitLocker?

Per Microsoft, "BitLocker Drive Encryption is a data protection feature that integrates with the operating system and addresses the threats of data theft or exposure from lost, stolen, or inappropriately decommissioned computers".

On devices with TPM installed, BitLocker offers the best protection.

Per Microsoft, "BitLocker provides the most protection when used with a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) version 1.2 or later. The TPM is a hardware component installed in many newer computers by the computer manufacturers. It works with BitLocker to help protect user data and to ensure that a computer has not been tampered with while the system was offline".

Refer to the official Microsoft documentation to learn more about BitLocker here. 

Note: The BitLocker feature is not included in the attached VM.
