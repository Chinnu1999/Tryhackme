# ðŸŸ¥ Task-9 Task Manager

The last subject that will be touched on in this module is the Task Manager.

The Task Manager provides information about the applications and processes currently running on the system. Other information is also available, such as how much CPU and RAM are being utilized, which falls under Performance. 

You can access the Task Manager by right-clicking the taskbar.
