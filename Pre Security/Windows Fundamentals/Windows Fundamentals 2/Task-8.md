# ðŸŸ¥ Task-8 Registry Editor

We're continuing with Tools that are available through the System Configuration panel.

The Windows Registry (per Microsoft) is a central hierarchical database used to store information necessary to configure the system for one or more users, applications, and hardware devices.

The registry contains information that Windows continually references during operation, such as:

- Profiles for each user
- Applications installed on the computer and the types of documents that each can create
- Property sheet settings for folders and application icons
- What hardware exists on the system
- The ports that are being used.

Warning: The registry is for advanced computer users. Making changes to the registry can affect normal computer operations. 

There are various ways to view/edit the registry. One way is to use the Registry Editor (regedit).
