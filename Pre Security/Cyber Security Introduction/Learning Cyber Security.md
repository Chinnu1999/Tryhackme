# Task 1  Web Application Security

## Why understanding how the web works is important

To attack web applications, you need to understand how they work. Hacking websites isn't some magical process but does come down to knowing how a part of a website functions and being able to identify weaknesses to take advantage of. Once you have a good understanding of the fundamentals, you'll learn about the techniques and tools used in hacking sites. 

If something is vulnerable, it means there is the possibility of it being attacked or harmed. If an application or system has a vulnerability, there is something that can be attacked or taken advantage of (a weakness).
