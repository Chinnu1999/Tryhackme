# ðŸŸ¥ Task-1  Web Application Security

## Why understanding how the web works is important

To attack web applications, you need to understand how they work. Hacking websites isn't some magical process but does come down to knowing how a part of a website functions and being able to identify weaknesses to take advantage of. Once you have a good understanding of the fundamentals, you'll learn about the techniques and tools used in hacking sites. 

If something is vulnerable, it means there is the possibility of it being attacked or harmed. If an application or system has a vulnerability, there is something that can be attacked or taken advantage of (a weakness).

Above is a learning path roadmap. The Pre Security path will teach you the technical knowledge you need to get started in cyber security. Once you understand the basics, enroll in either the Offensive Pentesting (ethically hacking systems) or the Cyber Defense (investigating attacks and defending systems) path.

The skills you acquire from the learning paths will prepare you for a career as an ethical hacker, penetration tester or cyber security analyst.
