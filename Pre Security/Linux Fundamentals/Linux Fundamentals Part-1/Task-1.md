Welcome to the first part of the "Linux Fundamentals" room series. You're most likely using a Windows or Mac machine, both are different in visual design and how they operate. Just like Windows, iOS and MacOS, Linux is just another operating system and one of the most popular in the world powering smart cars, android devices, supercomputers, home appliances, enterprise servers, and more.

We'll be covering some of the history behind Linux and then eventually starting your journey of being a Linux-wizard! This room will have you:

     * Running your very first commands in an interactive Linux machine in your browser
     * Teaching you some essential commands used to interact with the file system
     * Introduce you to how users and groups work on Linux (and what this means for us as penetration testers)
