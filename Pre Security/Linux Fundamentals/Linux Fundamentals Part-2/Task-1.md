Welcome to the second part of the reworked "Linux Fundamentals" series. We'll be applying our knowledge from the first installment in this series, so I highly recommend you completing that room before proceeding further.

In part 2, we'll be ditching the in-browser functionality and help you get started in what is a fundamental skill in being able to login to and control the terminals of remote machines. Not only this, but the room will also have you:

    -> Unlocking the potential of your first few commands by introducing you to using flags and arguments
    -> Advancing your knowledge of the filesystem to perform some more useful commands such as copying and moving files
    -> Introducing you to the access mechanisms in place to keep files and folders secure and how to identify the things that our current user has access too
    -> Running your first few scripts and executables!
