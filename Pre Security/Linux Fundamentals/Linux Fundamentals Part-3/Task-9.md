# ðŸŸ¥ Task-9 Conclusions & Summaries

Welcome to the end of the Linux Fundamentals module. Your familiarity with Linux will improve as you get to interact with it over time. Linux has the potential to do very powerful things with relative ease (as you have hopefully discovered throughout this module)

To recap, this room introduced you to the following topics:

- Using terminal text editors
- General utilities such as downloading and serving contents using a python webserver
- A look into processes
- Maintaining & automating your system by the use of crontabs, package management, and reviewing logs
