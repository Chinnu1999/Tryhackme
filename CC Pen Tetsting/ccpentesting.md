Task-1 Introduction
-------------------

The idea behind this room is to provide an introduction to various tools and concepts commonly encountered in penetration testing. 

This room assumes that you have basic linux and networking knowledge. This room is also not meant to be a "be all end all" for penetration testing

The tasks in this room can be completed in any order; however, if you are new to penetration testing, completing the first two sections is recommended before doing anything else.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Task-2 Section-1 (Network Utilities) Nmap

nmap is one of the most important tools in a pen testers arsenal. It allows a pen tester to see which ports are open, and information about which services are running on those ports. Ergo this task will focus on showing you nmap's various flags. The beginning questions can be completed by using the nmap man page; The final questions will require you to deploy the machine.

Answer the questions below -------------------------------------------------------------------
