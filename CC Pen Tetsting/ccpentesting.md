游린 Task-1 Introduction in red 
-------------------

The idea behind this room is to provide an introduction to various tools and concepts commonly encountered in penetration testing. 

This room assumes that you have basic linux and networking knowledge. This room is also not meant to be a "be all end all" for penetration testing

The tasks in this room can be completed in any order; however, if you are new to penetration testing, completing the first two sections is recommended before doing anything else.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

游린 Task-2 Section-1 (Network Utilities) Nmap
-----------------------------------------

nmap is one of the most important tools in a pen testers arsenal. It allows a pen tester to see which ports are open, and information about which services are running on those ports. Ergo this task will focus on showing you nmap's various flags. The beginning questions can be completed by using the nmap man page; The final questions will require you to deploy the machine.

Answer the questions below -------------------------------------------------------------------

1. What does nmap stand for?

游린 Task-3 Section-1 (Network Utilities) Netcat
---

Netcat aka nc is an extremely versatile tool. It allows users to connect to specific ports and send and receive data. It also allows machines to receive data and connections on specific ports, which makes nc a very popular tool to gain a Reverse Shell.

After you connect to a port with nc you will be able to send data, this also has the consequence of the user being able to pipe data through nc. For example one can do echo hello | nc ip 1234 to send the string hello to the service running on port 1234
  
Note: There are multiple versions of nc, so if you are unable to find an answer in your specific man page, try reading the man page for others!

游린 Task-4 Section-2 (Web Enumeration) Gobuster
---
One of the main problems of web penetration testing is not knowing where anything is. Basic reconnaissance can tell you where some files and directories are; however, some of the more hidden stuff is often hidden away from the eyes of users. This is where gobuster comes in, the idea behind gobuster is that it tries to find valid directories from a wordlist of possible directories. gobuster can also be used to valid subdomains using the same method.

The beginning questions of this task use the gobuster man page, while the latter questions will use a virtual machine. 

In the event your operating system does not provide the gobuster man page, please use gobuster --help 

Answer the questions below ----------------------------------

Metasploit is one of the most popular penetration testing frameworks around. It contains a large database of almost every major CVE, which you can easily use against a machine. The aim of this section is to go through some of the major features of metasploit, and at the end there will be a machine that you will need to exploit. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

游린 Task-7  Section-3 (Metasploit) Setting Up
